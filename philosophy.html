                Minimalism came about as a response of sorts to mid-century modernism. 
                The chief values of minimalism are minimal complication and maximal utility.
                Minimalism is an accepted and widely known design philosophy that is a dominant force in design today.

                But in order to understand minimalism, we must return to study the philosophy of Mid-century modernism.
                This movement was first begun shortly after the Second World War, and lasted throughout the Sixties.
                In keeping with the Space Age and the aesthetics of the time, Mid-century modernism 
                involves sleek and clear lines, with clear functionality.
