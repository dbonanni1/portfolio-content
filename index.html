                This site is a compilation of a few of my favorite interiors and exteriors, with a focus on architecture that is both modern and stylish. 
                I have had a passion for interior design and architecture for quite some time,
                so I look forward to using this site as a space for compiling some of my favorite designs and spaces.
                Over time, I would like to develop this site to reflect similar colors and shapes as the modernist designs that can be found here.

                    These photos primarily reflect designs that are either minimalist or mid-century modern.
                Minimalism is an artistic philosophy that holds the adage 'less is more' as the guiding principle.
                Mid-century modernism is reflective of earlier trends in American design from the 40s to the late 60s
                that emphasize sleek lines, unification of form and function, and careful graftsmanship.
